dnsproxy2 - a replacement DNS proxy for Android 4.3+

This currently allows the user to manually override the DNS server IP,
and it sets the correct UID on outbound requests so they can be filtered
via iptables / AFWall+ / DroidWall / etc.


Requirements:

Root access

Write access to /system

/etc/init.d (if you want to start it on boot)


armv6 4.4.4 (cm11) build method used:
1) Install android build system including the device/vendor folders you're building for

2) as if you're going to build for your device, do the ". build/envsetup.sh" and "lunch" steps to setup the build environment and choose your device

3) clone this repo into $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/external/dnsproxy2

4) make dnsproxy2

5) the binary is at $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/out/target/product/name of YOUR DEVICE/system/bin/dnsproxy2


Installation:

Make sure adb is in your PATH and functional, then on your PC host run:

adb remount
adb push $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP/out/target/product/name of YOUR DEVICE/system/bin/dnsproxy2 /system/xbin/dnsproxy2
adb shell chmod 755 /system/xbin/dnsproxy2

which installs the dnsproxy2 binary into /system/xbin



Original build instructions:

1) Install NDK r8e under /opt/android-ndk

2) Run /opt/android-ndk/ndk-build

3) Binaries are under libs/.  Most devices will use libs/armeabi-v7a/


Original installation instructions:

Make sure adb is in your PATH and functional, then on your PC host run:

bash misc/install.sh

This installs /system/xbin/dnsproxy2 and /etc/init.d/20dnsproxy2

To uninstall, remount /system read-write and delete those files.
